1. Function validate_ip(ip)

    Purpose: Validates whether an IP address is valid.

    Explanation: It uses a regular expression (pattern) to check if the IP follows the correct format. The correct format for an IPv4 address is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, where each segment (xxx) can be a number between 0 and 255.

    How it works:

        The regular expression ensures each part of the IP is between 0 and 255.

        re.fullmatch() is used to ensure that the entire IP matches the pattern.

        If the IP is valid, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

2. Function load_ips_from_file(file)

    Purpose: Loads IP addresses from a file, validates them, and stores them in two lists: one for valid IPs and another for invalid IPs.

    Explanation:

        It opens the text file file containing the IP addresses.

        It reads the file line by line and cleans each line (removing newlines and extra spaces).

        Then, it validates each IP using the validate_ip function.

        Valid IPs are stored in a set called valid_ips (sets automatically handle duplicates), and invalid IPs are stored in a list called invalid_ips.

    Error Handling: If the file is not found, it catches the FileNotFoundError and displays a warning message.

3. Function generate_firewall_config(valid_ips)

    Purpose: Generates a firewall configuration for the valid IPs.

    Explanation:

        It creates a block of text containing commands to configure firewall addresses using the valid IPs.

        For each valid IP, it generates a CLI command block to create a firewall address with the specific IP.

        The resulting configuration is returned as a string.

4. Function generate_addrgrp_config(valid_ips)

    Purpose: Generates an address group (addrgrp) configuration for the valid IPs.

    Explanation:

        It creates a block of text containing commands to add the valid IPs to a firewall address group called Blacklist9.

        For each valid IP, it appends an append member command to include that IP in the address group.

        The resulting configuration is returned as a string.

5. Main Execution Flow

    Load IPs: It calls load_ips_from_file, passing the file ips.txt, which contains the IPs to be validated.

    Generate Configurations: If valid IPs are found, two configurations are generated:

        A firewall configuration using generate_firewall_config.

        An address group configuration using generate_addrgrp_config.

    Display Results: If there are valid IPs, the generated configurations are printed. If there are invalid IPs, those IPs are printed for review.

Summary:

This code has three main purposes:

    IP Validation: It checks whether the IP addresses in the file are valid.

    Configuration Generation: If the IPs are valid, it generates specific firewall and address group configurations for those IPs.

    Error Management: If the file is not found, it shows an error message and prevents the program from crashing.

In summary, the program is designed to read IP addresses from a file, validate them, generate security configurations (firewall and addrgrp) for the valid IPs, and display the invalid IPs for further inspection.
